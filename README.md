A simple hangman game that I made in the programing language Python. 

The words are names of countries around the world. I asked ChatGPT to come up with the hints for each country.

The user can ask for hints (up to three) and try to guess the whole word instead of guessing letters (but if incorrect, then it's game over). 

The hangman figure is drawn before each user input.

A function to clear the terminal is used throughout the program. It was made using Windows 'CLS' command to do that. The program may need some adjustments to work on other Operating Systems
